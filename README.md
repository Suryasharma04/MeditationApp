# Meditation Mobile Application

Introducing a peaceful and easy-to-use meditation app crafted to bring tranquility and mindfulness into your busy day. With its simple and clean design, this app offers a timer feature allowing you to set your meditation duration down to the hour, minute, and second, giving you full control over your practice. You can start, pause, and stop the timer at your convenience. 

In addition to the timer, the app features a breathing exercise tool represented by a circle on the main screen. This circle guides your breathing rhythm, helping you inhale and exhale deeply to enhance relaxation and focus.

It was built using Swift on Xcode.
